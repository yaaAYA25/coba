    <h1>About Whales</h1>
    <p>
        Whales are magnificent marine mammals that belong to the order Cetacea. They are known for their incredible size, intelligence, and importance to the marine ecosystem. There are two main types of whales: baleen whales and toothed whales.
    </p>

    <h2>Baleen Whales</h2>
    <p>
        Baleen whales filter feed on small organisms such as krill and plankton using their baleen plates. Examples include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Blue Whale:</strong> The largest animal on Earth, capable of reaching lengths of up to 100 feet.</li>
        <li><strong>Humpback Whale:</strong> Known for their beautiful songs and acrobatic breaches.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>

    <h2>Toothed Whales</h2>
    <p>
        Toothed whales are predators that hunt fish, squid, and other marine animals using echolocation. Examples include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sperm Whale:</strong> The largest toothed predator, famous for its deep dives and association with ambergris.</li>
        <li><strong>Orca (Killer Whale):</strong> A highly social and intelligent species, often seen in pods.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Whales play a crucial role in the health of marine ecosystems by maintaining balance in the food web and contributing to the carbon cycle.
